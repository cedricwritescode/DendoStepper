# DendoStepper

Work in progress, maybe unstable.  
This library takes care of pulse generating for stepper motor drivers with STEP/DIR interface. Pulse generating utilizes general purpose timers to achieve some usable accuracy and smoothnes.  
Currently supports only linear acceleration and deceleration, exponential profile is TBD.
Documentation will be available soon.
